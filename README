APIs
======
ReportingDaoFactory is the factory class which gives the required dao
when respective Entity class is passed.
eg.
BaseDao advDao = ReportingDaoFactory.getInstance().getDAO(Advertiser.class);

Each entity implements an Entity marker interface. 
Below is the way to save/delete/getAll an entity type.
eg.
BaseEntity entity = new Advertiser();
advDao.save(entity);

Each DAO class extends abstract class BaseDao which has 3 methods:
1. save : creates or updates given entity object
2. delete: deletes given entity object
3. getAll: returns list of all objects from the table
Each dao has a method "getByPrimaryKey" which enables a look up on 
primary key of the table.

Check unit tests for more usage details.
